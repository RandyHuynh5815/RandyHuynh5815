## Hi There! 👋

### My name is Randy Huynh (he/him/his), and I am currently a fourtg-year CS major at the University of California, Irvine.  

I have many interests in both computer science and statistics and am currently an aspiring machine learning engineer, data scientist, and computer science professor.
I am currently working as a undergraduate researcher for [Professor Michael Shindler](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~mikes/), front-end developer on the ICSSC Projects Committee, mentor for AI@UCI and a Tech Organizer for Hack@UCI. My works will touch upon the fields of web development, ML, NLP, statistics and data science.
