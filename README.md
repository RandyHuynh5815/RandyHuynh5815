### Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Randy Huynh, and I am currently a second-year CS major at the University of California, Irvine.  

I have many interests in both computer science and mathematics, and am currently an aspiring machine learning engineer, data scientist and computer science professor.
I am currently working as a undergraduate researcher for [Professor Theodore van Erp](https://cnlm.uci.edu/erp/), front-end developer on the ICSSC Projects Committee, mentor for AI@UCI and an ICS lab tutor. As you look at my works, you will see me bridge theory and application in the computer science field.  

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/randy-huynh-a917161b5/). View my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m1T9GcqH7yYIJi_hjLegBBPKiMfL3P8H/view?usp=sharing).
